			<h3>Question 4:Do you offer in-store pick-up ?</h3>
			<div class="content">
				<div class="content-inner">
					<p>Yes, we do! Our flagship store is located in Omaha, Nebraska, and our second brick-and-mortar store is located in Overland Park in the Kansas City, Kansas area. If your zip code is near either of our stores, a ship-to-store option will show up on the check-out page. There is no shipping charge to pick up an order in one of our stores, although sales tax is calculated for those locations..</p>
